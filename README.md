## Project Details
This assignment is to create a java program that can simulate the card game "War"
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game) for instructions on game play.
In the event that a player runs out of cards during a war/double war/triple war/etc, use their last remaining card to resolve the war, while their opponent continues to deal cards normally
This game should not be interactive, but you could add a separate interactive mode if you choose.
Instead, your program should run 1000 independent games, and monitor the outcome to produce statistics.
Your program must write these statistics to a file called stats.txt


This project can be completed either individually, or in pairs.
If working with a partner, both students must submit identical code to blackboard, and specify their partner in a readme file


Your output should include all of the following statistics in the following format:

For 1000 games ...

- Average number of battles per game: 321.2
- Average number of wars per game: 24.3
- Average number of double wars per game: 0.5
- Max number of battles in a game: 1234
- Min number of battles in a game: 12
- Max number of wars in a game: 123
- Min number of wars in a game: 1
